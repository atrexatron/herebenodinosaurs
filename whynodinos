<p><strong>Dinosaurs! Dinosaurs everywhere!</strong></p>

<p>It started as a joke between myself and one of my best friends. “So, when do you get to start digging up dinosaurs?” This was when I first started school, when I was taking my first archaeology classes – and it was funny – the first dozen or so times. </p>

<p>Since then I have heard more than a few people reference this in one way or another. Friends, fellow students, teachers, in podcasts, on twitter – everywhere I look, people (mostly Archaeologist type folk) seem to have been dealing with the same “joke”. </p>

<p>Repeat after me: “Archaeologists don’t dig up dinosaurs. <strong>Paleontologists dig up dinosaurs! </strong>” </p>

<p>Ok, so now that we’ve got that cleared up, let’s talk about what archaeologists <strong>actually do</strong></p>

<p>Archeology is, by strict definition, the study of humanity’s past using the things that were left behind.  Go ahead, Google it, I’ll wait. </p>

<p>Yeah, I know, the definition that Google spit out at you had all kinds of weird words in it (like artifact and excavation) – it all translates to what I said before: the study of humanity’s past using the things that were left behind.</p>

<p>But, you ask, what does it all mean?!</p>

<p>It means that Archaeologists spend a lot of time studying places that they <i>think</i> people in the past may have lived and traveled. Then, if their lucky they might get a chance to actually go out and dig holes in some of these places.  Then if all the stars align just right, and they’ve dug their holes in the right places, then maybe, just maybe they might find one or two <strong>artifacts</strong> (items from the past) in the dirt from those holes.  If luck continues to shine on that Archaeologist, those artifacts from those holes may lead to an <strong>excavation</strong> (carefully and methodically searing through layers and layers of dirt and sediments) to discover what kinds of things people from the past left behind. </p>

<p>There are, of course, other types of Archaeology.  Some is done underwater – working to find lost ships and other sunken artifacts.  Some Archaeologists work only with specific geographic areas like Vancouver Island, or in a specialized field like Mortuary Archaeology, some work for museums, still others work for companies who specialize in Archaeological excavation and preservation – some Archaeologists write, some teach, some work in the field, some work in their homes, some work for governments, others work for universities – the field is vast and varied in its possibilities!</p>

<p>But, really and truly, Archaeologist don’t dig up dinosaurs! (At least not on purpose)</p>
