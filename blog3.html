        <p>If you live in Victoria you probably know about the Gorge Waterway.  That beautiful inlet that runs from the Tillicum Bridge, under the Admirals Bridge, all the way down to where it meets Colquitz Creek.  You can walk along a lot of the Gorge, paths and parkway line both sides of this arm of the ocean that reaches inland from the harbour.  In the Gorge Park, you can find signs talking about the history of the area, however, these signs leave out a large part of the story – the Gorge was important long before Victorian era settlers arrived in the area and started hosting boat regattas along this serene channel.  The thing is, the archaeology is there! You just have to know where to look.</p>

<p>Even if you are familiar with the Gorge, you may not know that you can walk under the Tillicum bridge – there’s a foot path.  This path lets you look out over the water, and a sign tells you of the unique geological feature located here – there is a reverse waterfall under the Tillicum Bridge!  When the tide changes the opening here is narrow and the tide changes faster than the water can empty from, or fill, the Gorge.  This affect is caused by rocks under the water at this point.  The signs posted here will tell you about a decision to remove some of these rocks by way of blasting – it was a safety issue, people were dying trying to get through that point in the waterway.</p>

<p>Now, here’s the thing – the signs leave out a huge part of the story – this area was HUGELY important before Victoria was Victoria. The rocks that were blasted to make the water way safer? Those rocks have a story – they are more than rocks, they are people…</p>

<p>I was told this story as a student at Camosun College, it is a Songhees story and I am summarizing it here. You can read the story as told by <a href=”http://camosun.ca/learn/school/indigenous-education-community-connections/about/” target=”_blank”>Cheryl Bryce</a> of the Songhees Nation on Camosun’s Website!</p>

<p>There was a flood (there are many stories about this in Indigenous communities up and down the Island and the West Coast), and after the flood a young girl and her grandfather were found by Haylas (the transformer).  The girl was crying and Haylas asked her why – she needed food and her Father would not provide.</p>

<p>Haylas offered her sturgeon, she didn’t want it, so he threw it into the Fraser River (known for its sturgeon), She didn’t want the cranberries so Haylas tossed them over to Shawnigan Lake (mmm, cranberries). This kept going – she did want duck and coho and oysters and other things that are found even today in the Gorge – she wanted so many things that Haylas declared she was greedy and as a result she had to look after the food for always.  He turned her and her grandfather into stone – the same stones that sit below the Tillicum bridge.</p>

<p>So, these stones, these stones are people – and important! They are there to protect the food that was gifted to the people of the area, their people.  </p>

<p>Now, I also learned in school that this area was an important area for trade amongst the local Indigenous communities and as such became an <a href=”http://www.saanich.ca/assets/Parks~Recreation~and~Culture/Documents/Camossung-Keddie.pdf” target=”_blank”> important area for trade</a> when Europeans first arrived… It was so important that Fort Victoria was almost called Camosun and was almost built near where the Tillicum bridge is today.  </p>

<p>These things, however, are not listed on the signs along the waterway – no mention of the importance of those rocks they blasted away.</p>

<p>Also located under the Tillicum bridge is an <a href=”http://staff.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Spirited-Divers-and-Spirited-Diggers-Keddie.pdf” target=”_blank”>old midden site</a> that was excavated and is visible from the pathway.  This midden comes from a time before Europeans arrived, at least 4000 years before; before there was a bridge across the Gorge, before Camosun and her grandfather were declared a safety hazard.  It’s there – surrounded by chain-link, but there, perfectly visible under the piles of the bridge above… but, like the history of the rocks under the bridge who are more than rocks, the signs about this midden barely graze the surface of the importance of this site.  </p>

<p>The history is there, right beneath our feet, unfortunately the knowledge sometimes requires a little deeper digging.  </p>
