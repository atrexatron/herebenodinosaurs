        </h2>
        <hr class="divider">

<p>December 6, 2017</p>

<p>So, for my final portfolio project in our Digital Archaeology class I have chosen to do an augmented reality project.  I chose to use the <a href=“https://www.aurasma.com/“ target=“_blank”>Aurasma</a> app to do this.  Aurasma is an awesome program - you upload a “trigger image” and use that to trigger the app on your phone or smart device to show further information.  This information shows up as an overlay on your device screen, “overlaying” the image below.  So, for my project, when you walk along the Gorge waterway you can use the Aurasma app on your phone to view the signs put there by the city and access further information about the history and heritage of that area. </p>

<p>Of course I chose to focus on the Gorge waterway, <a href=“blog-2.html” target=“_blank”>again</a> - I currently live along the Gorge, but even before I moved into the neighbourhood I would frequently travel down to enjoy the water and the walking paths in this area.  As I’ve been a student I have had the opportunity to learn more about the history of this special area than is offered up by the signs that explain early settler life along the Gorge. As I have learned these things I have become more and more uncomfortable with the narrow narrative that is present in these signs and my current project works to give access to a deeper story.</p>

<p>The <a href=“https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HvxVxzr5Xvp8FFY24Lh-GxC5f3ulv-iY&usp=sharing” target=“_blank”>Google Map</a> that I created for my previous portfolio project focused on both colonial and pre-contact histories.  For this project I wanted to focus the histories on Indigenous and non-European people who have inhabited this area.</p>

<p>There is an archaeologist from Kamloops, Joanne Hammond (<a href=“https://twitter.com/KamloopsArchaeo” target=“_blank”>@KamloopsArchaeo</a>) has been working on a project where she is recreating the BC Heritage signs that exist across the province - updating them with real, deeper Canadian history than the glossed over, colonial history that they currently portray.  Her project definitely inspired mine - I love the idea of challenging the commonly held narratives, adding in deeper histories and layers of stories… or in the case of Hammond, straight up calling out the <a href=“http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2017/02/09/bcs-racist-historical-signs-have-got-to-go-.html” target=“_blank”>racism inherent in these signs</a> and the one sided history they tell. My project is nowhere near as in-depth as hers, I am in awe of the way that she uses words - so succinct and right to the point.</p>

<p>I created four “Auras” for my project.  (Auras are the trigger images + their overlays + any actions you want to happen when someone taps the overlay image on their device.) The first one I did was to draw attention to the midden site under the Tillicum Bridge.  The first time I did it the overlay was not large enough to be read when I tested it out at the sign. The image I had attempted to overlay was a screenshot that was too small and not focused enough to be useable.  So I went back to the drawing board - how to make overlays that were large enough and clear enough to be useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://piktochart.com/" target="_blank">Piktochart</a> is a fantastic program! I used Piktochart to create this <a href="https://create.piktochart.com/output/26619340-law-of-stratigraphy" target="_blank">infographic</a> and knew how quick and easy it was to create image based files - so I decided to create my overlays using this platform.
