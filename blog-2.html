<p>For our first project my digital anthropology class we designed this webpage – voila! It was hard, but I did it.  It’s not perfect, but it’s functional. For our second project in this class we are focusing on digital visualization tools and have been given the parameters of this year’s <a href="http://www.heritagejam.org/" target="_blank">Heritage Jam</a> - “The Bones of our Past” - to follow.  I went through a couple of different ideas – first I thought I might be able to create a timeline of the reclamation by the LGBTQ community of words that have been used as slurs at one point or another.  I’m a strong believer in the importance of words – if you start looking at it, individual words have history, and that history influences the ways that words are used and how their meanings change over time.  I thought that it would be interesting to explore words that had derogatory meanings historically and look at how those words had been reclaimed by those they had been used against.  However, when I started looking at it I realized (surprise, surprise) that it’s not as simple as drawing a timeline – words and their meanings are different across time and space.  There are words used by some LGBTQ communities in places like the Pacific North West that are considered to be wholly derogatory by the LGBTQ community living in places like the Southern United States.  So, I stepped back from this idea and decided to look at my own family instead. </p>

<p>My great, great, grandfather Abraham McCulley – my father’s mother’s mother’s father – was a ship builder and captain of the Vilda Ayer, which (according to what I can recall my grandmother telling me) was used mostly to haul lumber up and down the East coast.  I have a copy of an old black and white photo of this ship – a photo that shows a ship similar enough to the one on the Canadian dime that when I was a child I believed my grandfather to be the captain of the Blue Nose! I decided that I wanted to attempt to create a 3D model of this ship – but I very quickly realized that I didn’t have the time I needed. I am by no means proficient with 3D modeling programs!</p>

<p>So, what to do? Well, I love local history – like, <strong>a lot</strong>.  My imagination goes wild trying to picture what the place I live in looked like in the past – and not just the recent past, I’m talking deep, deep, back-to-the-last-ice-age kinda past.  (Seriously though, the work being done on things like ocean level changes and ice coverage in North America is fascinating!) So, I decided to focus my attention on the Gorge Waterway, specifically the Tillicum Narrows, where the Tillicum Bridge crosses the Gorge, and two parks close by – The Gorge Park and the Esquimalt Gorge Park.</p>

<p>I chose to create an interactive map detailing some of the history of the Gorge that is not present in the signs and common knowledge of this area. I was already aware of a lot of the history that I’ve incorporated into this map, but I was happy to learn so much more! The research for this project was propped up by archaeological writings, photographs from the <a href="https://royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/bc-archives/info/about-bc-archives" target="_blank">BC Archives</a>, and information from different city and local history websites.  I love doing research, this part was really enjoyable!  Making the map itself… not so much.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target=”_blank”>MapBox</a> to create my map and I could not get the final step complete!  I was able to create the map, create the data points, and create pop up boxes on the map to present the information I wanted to – and that’s where things broke and I couldn’t figure out how to fix them.  This is the map I created: <a href="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/atrexatron/cj9hd9ysb6onl2sp4k6lll2v1.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYXRyZXhhdHJvbiIsImEiOiJjajhvcG5vc2kwNXU3Mndyc3o1ajg2dDBzIn0.LYqj--9dBxlPk_p-M5pLCA#15.8/48.446727/-123.402360/0" target="_blank">My Map</a>. I wasn't able to figure out how to make my pop-ups show in the map that I'm sharing... seriously though, it all went sideways!</p>

<p>Since I couldn’t get the MapBox map to work for me I decided to create a map quickly using Google Maps so that I could still show the data points with their labels: <p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1HvxVxzr5Xvp8FFY24Lh-GxC5f3ulv-iY" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 
</div>

<p>I’ve also included the information below that would have been included in my MapBox map if I had been able to make the code work for me. </p>

<p>I like the idea of an interactive map that people can access while they are in the space.  Gorge Park and Esquimalt Gorge Park both have pedestrian paths, and the points on my map are either visabale or accessable from the pathways.</p>

<p>I created eight data points for this map:</p>
<ul>
<a href="#curtis"><li>Curtis Point</li></a>
<a href="#swimhouse"><li>Swim house</li></a>
<a href="#swimming"><li>Swimming on the Gorge</li></a>
<a href="#falls"><li>The Reverse Falls</li></a>
<a href="#midden"><li>The Midden</li></a>
<a href="#boating"><li>Boating Regattas</li></a>
<a href="#tea"><li>Japanese Tea House</li></a>
<a href="#recreation"><li>Recreation in the Park</li></a>
</ul>

<p>For each of these points I found pictures and historical information, using city websites, blogs, and old publications to add to the story told by the signs along the pathways in these two parks – a lot of this information is missing from the signs along the walking paths in Gorge and Esquimalt Gorge Parks. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: This post is super picture heavy! Please forgive me, it was all intended to be embeded in my map.</p>

<h3>The Parks</h3>

<p>The parks at the Tillicum narrows were officially established in 1905 by the <a href=”https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/initiatives-pdf/gwi-pdf/interpretive-signs/recreation-destination.pdf?sfvrsn=2” target="_blank"> BC Electric Railway Company </a> though people have been using the waterway for much, much longer. </p>

<h4 id="curtis">Curtis Point</h4>

<p>Curtis Point juts out into the Gorge Waterway as you look from the Tillicum Bridge towards downtown Victoria.  Today there is a walking path that will take you out to the end and people frequently swim in the deep waters off the point during warmer months.  In 1918 the Victoria and Island Athletic Association (VIAA) built the <a href="http://www.gorgeswimfest.ca/history-of-the-gorge-swimming-galas-along-the-gorge-waterway/">first high-dive tower in Victoria</a>.  They built it to celebrate both Victoria Day and Canada Day that year. Though popular, an accident on the diving tower in 1922 marked the end of diving at Curtis Point.</p>

<p>If you stand on the Tillicum Bridge, facing towards downtown Victoria, and look down and to your left you will see a dock.  The swim house in the photo sat near this spot on the Gorge almost 100 years ago. The Gorge is still a popular swimming area and the dock is used frequently in the summer time by swimmers.</p>

  <p>Swimming in th Gorge has been a favorite pastime for a long time.  From the late 1890s to the 1930s swimming competitions were a common occurrence along the Gorge.  Different swimming clubs have used the waterway to practice and host to swimming regattas throughout the years. The Victoria Amature Swim Club has existed in Victoria for over <a href="https://www.teamunify.com/SubTabGeneric.jsp?team=cais&_stabid_=6986" target="_blank">100 years</a> and spent their first few years in a clubhouse along the Gorge.</p>
  <p>The opening of Crystal Pool in 1926, and an increase of pollution from residential and industrial development along the Gorge, led to a reduction and eventual end to swimming in the waterway by the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/education/our-environment/harbours/gorge-waterway/history-uses" target="_blank">1930's</a>. In the 1990s a father and son team started cleaning garbage out of the Gorge, sparking community and buisness interest in revitalizing the health of the Gorge Waterway ecosystem. Every year different community organizations, including the <a href="http://www.vckc.ca/" target="_blank">Victoria Canoe and Kayak Club</a>, host clean-up events to help remove garbage from the water and the shore. These efforts, along with changes in city regulations around what's allowed to be dumped into our waterways, the Gorge is <a href="http://crdcommunitygreenmap.ca/story/are-you-afraid-swim-gorge-waterway" target="_blank">safe to swim in again</a>. The <a href="http://www.gorgeswimfest.ca/" target="_blank">Gorge Swim Fest</a>, a yearly swimming event on the Gorge, has helped raise awareness in recent years about the history of the waterway as well as encouraging the public to enjoy swimming in this special place.</p>

<p>The reverse waterfall underneath the Tillicum bridge is a facsinating natural phenomenon.  As the tides change the water cannot pass through the Tillicum Narrows as fast as the shift happens in the main harbour.  This creates a waterfall that reverses direction as the tides come in and out.  It's a fantastic sight to witness and there is a viewing platform above the falls under the bridge that is easily accessible. The rapids created by the falls are not something that inexperienced paddlers should undertake, and in the past these falls have caused the death of people caught in the current.</p>
<p>Before 1960 there were <a href="https://victoriakayak.com/canal-of-camosack/" target="_blank">two large boulders</a> that sat in the Tillicum Narrows. The boudlers created whirlpools and currents at the changing tides that were incredibly hazardous. A local man, Robert Southwell, upset with the dangers presented by the Narrows and possibly frustrated with the City's response to the issue, took it upon himself to remove the boulders using dynamite. Though his efforts did remove large portions of the boulders, it also caused public outcry. These boulders were not just part of an amazing natural feature - they were also significant to the local Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>A Songhees tale tells the story of <a href="http://www.saanich.ca/assets/Parks~Recreation~and~Culture/Documents/Camossung-Keddie.pdf" target="_blank">Camossung and her Grandfather</a>. In the story there is a flood that destroys their home and Camossung and her Grandfather were starving. Camossung asks for help and it comes to her in the form of a god offering her food. Different versions tell this slightly differently, but in all of them she is offered a variety of food and what she accepts - duck, herring, coho, oysters, etc. - are placed in the Gorge by the god (and were all traditionally foods of local Indigenous peoples living on the Gorge). To protect the food Camossung and her grandfater were turned into stone to protect the resources in the Gorge. The stones that Robert Southwell choose to remove are these stones.</p>

<h4 id="Midden">The Midden</h4>
               <p>There is a midden site under the Tillicum Bridge that has been dated to be at least <a href="http://staff.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Spirited-Divers-and-Spirited-Diggers-Keddie.pdf" target="_blank">4000 years old</a>. In the early 1990s archaeologist <a href="http://staff.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/author/rbcm_gkeddie/" target="_blank">Grant Keddie</a> and a team excavated a test pit at this site. They found examples of local oysters, bent-nose clams, bay muscles, and fish bones in the midden - showing examples of what local Indigenous peoples ate over time. The excavation did not reach the bottom of the midden and it is believed that the site may be more than 5000 years old. The site is preserved under the Tillicum Bridge and the different shell layers are visible from the public path that goes under the bridge into Esquimalt-Gorge park.</p>

               <p>The Gorge has always attracted boaters. Kayaks and canoes are a regular sight on both sides of the Narrows during all months of the year; outrigger canoe and dragon boat teams use the Gorge to practice. Boatting events are also commonly held along the Gorge - dragon boat races attract large crowds at different clubs throughout the summer months.</p>

               <p>In 1907 the Japanese Tea Gardens opened in Esquimalt-Gorge Park.  The gardens attracted many people and the buildings along the paths sold tea and other refreshments and hosted childrens games. The Japanese Tea Gardens operated for three decades - however, in World War II, after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, Japanese-Canadians were not allowed to live along the coast of British Columbia.  Durig this time the family that operated the gardens, the Takata family, were forced to leave Victoria. After this the gardens closed and the buildings were torn down.</p>

               <p>Today the gardens have been revitalized, at least in part.  Though none of the original buildings still stand, the gardens and some of the water features have been restored by the city of Esquimalt, a nod to the memory of a local attraction. Though there are signs letting visitors know that there used to be an establishment here, there is no information about the family that ran the Japanese Tea Gardens, nor of the history of the <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/japanese-internment-banished-and-beyond-tears-feature/" target="_blank">forced relocation and internment of Japanese-Canadians during World War II</a>.</p>

<p>Victoria's residence have always enjoyed different recreational activities in the two parks, especially Esquimalt-Gorge Park.  The Japanese Tea Gardens, an orchastra gazebo, and a beautiful beach were all popular reasons to visit the park in times past.  Today the parks have walking trails, benches, a playground, beach access, and a nature house to enjoy. On any given day you can still see families enjoying the lawns, paths, gardens, and waterfront as they have been doing for over 100 years.</p>

<h4>So What Did I Learn?</h4>

<p>Well, I learned that I've got a long way to go with HTML! My issues with the Mapbox map were because I'm struggling really hard with HTML.  This blog post, for example - I was able to figure out how to embed videos and images, link them to their source, and add captions below! Which is super cool - but I still can't figure out how to wrap text around my images, or how to make the images shrink to fit a screan when viewed on a mobile device.  So there are large chunks of empty space in my post that I would like to eliminate - and may come back to fix at a later date when I have some time.</p>

<p>I also have to say that in my experience, as someone who is not comfortable with the finicky nature of HTML coding, Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/" target="_blank">My Maps</a> was super easy and quick to use.  I spent hours and hours creating my failed Mapbox map - I spent about 20 minutes creating the Google Map. The map I created is really basic, but if I had wanted to I could have quickly added further information for each point, including images and video. I chose not to for time sake, though I will probably go back and add that information into the map later. If I had a lot of data to add to a map Google gives the option of doing this using spreadsheet databases.  Another thing that I appreciate about My Maps is their mobile app, the app lets you add points to maps in real time using your device's GPS.</p>

<p>I also learned not to try to mess with your CSS files when you're already late on an assignment - you <strong>will</strong> mess up your blog post and you <strong>will</strong> have a stress freak out about it and want to give up on all technology and live the rest of your life off-grid in the mountains just so you never have to think about coding ever, ever again.</p>
