<p>For our first project my digital anthropology class we designed this webpage – voila! It was hard, but I did it.  It’s not perfect, but it’s functional. For our second project in this class we are focusing on digital visualization tools and have been given the parameters of this year’s <a href="http://www.heritagejam.org/" target="_blank">Heritage Jam</a> - “The Bones of our Past” - to follow.  I went through a couple of different ideas – first I thought I might be able to create a timeline of the reclamation by the LGBTQ community of words that have been used as slurs at one point or another.  I’m a strong believer in the importance of words – if you start looking at it, individual words have history, and that history influences the ways that words are used and how their meanings change over time.  I thought that it would be interesting to explore words that had derogatory meanings historically and look at how those words had been reclaimed by those they had been used against.  However, when I started looking at it I realized (surprise, surprise) that it’s not as simple as drawing a timeline – words and their meanings are different across time and space.  There are words used by some LGBTQ communities in places like the Pacific North West that are considered to be wholly derogatory by the LGBTQ community living in places like the Southern United States.  So, I stepped back from this idea and decided to look at my own family instead. </p>

<p>My great, great, grandfather – my father’s mother’s mother’s father – was a ship builder and captain of the AVADA ALDA, which (according to what I can recall my grandmother telling me) was used mostly to haul lumber up and down the East coast.  I have a copy of an old black and white photo of this ship – a photo that showed a ship so similar to the one on the Canadian dime that when I was a child I believed my grandfather to be the captain of the Blue Nose! I decided that I wanted to attempt to create a 3d model of this ship – but I very quickly realized that I didn’t have the time I needed. I am by no means proficient with 3D modeling programs!</p>

<p>So, what to do? Well, I love local history – like, <strong>a lot</strong>.  My imagination goes wild trying to picture what the place I live in looked like in the past – and not just the recent past, I’m talking deep, deep, back-to-the-last-ice-age kinda past.  (Seriously though, the work being done on things like ocean level changes and ice coverage in North America is fascinating!) So, I decided to focus my attention on the Gorge Waterway, specifically the Tillicum Narrows and two parks close by – The Gorge Park and the Esquimalt Gorge Park. </p>

<p>I chose to create an interactive map detailing some of the history of the Gorge that is not present in the signs and common knowledge of this area. I was already aware of a lot of the history that I’ve incorporated into this map, but I was happy to learn so much more! The research for this project was propped up by archaeological writings, photographs from the BC Archives (LINK THIS), and information from different city and local history websites (see below for a list of references).  I love doing research, this part was really enjoyable!  Making the map itself… not so much.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target=”_blank”>MapBox</a> to create my map and I could not get the final step complete!  I was able to create the map, create the data points, and create pop up boxes on the map to present the information I wanted to – and that’s where things broke and I couldn’t figure out how to fix them.  This is the map I created: <a href=”map.html” target=”_blank”>My Map</a>. (LINK THIS!!) You can see what I’m talking about – the data I put into the title and description fields of my dataset did not display correctly, and every time I tried to fix this it created more errors.</p>

<p>Since I couldn’t get the MapBox map to work for me I decided to create a map quickly using Google Maps so that I could still show the data points with their labels and the information that I found: <p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1HvxVxzr5Xvp8FFY24Lh-GxC5f3ulv-iY" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 
</div>

<p>I’ve also included the information below that would have been included in my MapBox map if I had been able to make the code work for me. </p>

<p>I created eight data points for this map:</p>
<ul>
<a href=”#curtis”><li>Curtis Point</li></a>
<a href=”#swimhouse”<li>Swim house</li></a>
<a href=”#swimming”><li>Swimming on the Gorge</li></a>
<a href=#falls”><li>The Reverse Falls</li></a>
<a href=”#midden”><li>The Midden</li></a>
<a href =”#boating”><li>Boating Regattas</li></a>
<a href=”#tea”><li>Japanese Tea House</li></a>
<a href=”#recreation”><li>Recreation in the Park</li></a>
</ul>

<p>For each of these points I found pictures and historical information, using city websites, blogs, and old publications to add to the story told by the signs along the pathways in these two parks.  – a lot of this information is missing from the signs along the walking paths in Gorge and Esquimalt Gorge Parks. </p>

<h3>The Parks</h3>

<p>The parks at the Tillicum narrows were officially established in 1905 by the <a href=”https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/initiatives-pdf/gwi-pdf/interpretive-signs/recreation-destination.pdf?sfvrsn=2” target="_blank"> BC Electric Railway Company </a> though people have been using the waterway for much, much longer. </p>

<h4 id=”curtis”>Curtis Point</h4>

<p>Curtis Point juts out into the Gorge Waterway as you look from the Tillicum Bridge towards downtown Victoria.  Today there is a walking path that will take you out to the tip and people frequently swim in the deep waters off the point.  In 1918 the Victoria and Island Athletic Association (VIAA) built the <a href=”http://www.gorgeswimfest.ca/history-of-the-gorge-swimming-galas-along-the-gorge-waterway/”> first high-dive tower in Victoria</a>.  They built it to celebrate both Victoria Day and Canada Day that year. An accident on the diving tower in 1922 marked the end of diving on Curtis Point.</p>
