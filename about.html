<p>Apparently when I was a kid, before I’d started school, I would happily spout off facts about Egyptian mummies to anyone who would listen - though my mom never knew where these facts had come from.  I’m sure it was PBS or CBC show about Egyptology and Archaeology, I was never able to consume enough of those as a kid.  I’ve always been in love with Archaeology!</p>

<p>When I decided to come back to school, many years after that picture was taken, I knew two things – that I wanted to help make positive change happen in the world around me, and that I needed to find a way to do that using Archaeology. </p>

<p>To better understand the history of the land that I live on (specifically, the unceded Coast Salish Territories of the Lekwungen and W_SÁNEC nations) I began by enrolling in the Indigenous Studies Diploma program at Camosun College in Victoria, BC.  I am incredibly privileged to have been a part of this program.  The traditional knowledge and ways of being that were shared openly with me, a non-indigenous person, was both humbling and amazing all rolled into one. I am so grateful for the base of understanding that this program has offered me in my journey through academia. </p>

<p>I’ve since moved on from Camosun and am at the University of Victoria dutifully working my way through an undergraduate degree in Anthropology focusing on, of course, <strong>Archaeology!</strong> </p>

<p>As I try to get those two little letters next to my name, and think about what might come next (grad school? eeek!) I find myself drawn more and more to learning how technology and Archaeology can be used together in sustainable and accessable ways.  This website is a space for me to explore the world of Archaeology, to look at how the relationship between technology and Archaeology is developing, to “Dig Deeper” into what it means to be an Archaeologist (No Dinosaurs!), and to showcase some of my own projects using digital tools to present Archaeological information! </p>

<p>So here it is, a student eye view of Archaeology.  Enjoy! </p>
